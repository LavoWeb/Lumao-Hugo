Akeneo is a **P**roduct **I**nformation **M**anagement. With this tool, you can manage product collections very easily.
For all formats, be it web, print, ERP data ...

The principle is that the PIM contains all the information of the products and is the master of the information. 
It is often coupled with a **D**ata **A**sset **M**anagement
which stores the media (photos, videos, music ...).

Akeneo is developed in Symfony 2 and is based on Oro Platform, a robust and actively developed framework.

We offer custom development on the Akeneo PIM.
